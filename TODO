After removing extern (C++) from all the backend files, now there are undefined symbol errors when compiling DMD.  This is because of how the DMD backend is designed.  It has function implementations in some modules, and then function declaration in other modules.  The implementation is part of the "backend sources" and the declarations are apart of the "backend headers".  The reason for the separation is an artifact of when the backend was written in C++.  Since it no longer is, we can essentially remove the backend headers, and just keep the backend sources.  However, we can't remove the extern (C++) until this happens because when we make the functions extern (C), then the symbols use the module they appear in as apart of their mangled name, so the implementation and header declaration no longer mangle the same way.
